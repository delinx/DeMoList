DML - DeMoLister
===============

Information
======

Concept
-----------

**DML** is a server side self sufficient CS:GO demo manager with a web interface, it can check FTP server for new .dem files, download and parse them, generate list of matches and match specific shareable links allowing to share demos with the other team easily.


Development
======

Modules
-----------
* Simple web server to be used with reverse proxy (*Apache / Nginx / etc*)
* Web interface
* FTP demo downloader
* .dem parser (no POV demo support, only server side demos)
* Generation of long term and per match statistics of players
* Generating sharable links to match pages allowing .dem download
* **No authentication or encryption systems are provided, use reverse proxy**

Notice
-----------
The goal is to write most of this project using C, this is a learning project for me and something I could actually use in day to day. I fully acknowledge this can be more easily accomplished using existing Go or JS demo parser with simple web interface on top and FTP module.

Tools you could use to accomplish this: 

* (Node)   https://github.com/saul/demofile
* (Go)     https://github.com/markus-wa/demoinfocs-golang
* (Python) https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/awpy

So please no "Why are you not using X instead", make your own project.
